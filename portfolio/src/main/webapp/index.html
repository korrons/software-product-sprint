      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is Korron Shivers, and I am a sophomore Computer Science major from Bowie, Maryland.
          I currently attend Hampton University, where I am a Resident Assistant and a member of the Association for Computing Machinery.
          I am an aspiring software engineer, as I believe in working towards the advancement and betterment of society. Some projects I have worked on include:

              <li>Created a program to find the shortest path to a point on a graph</li>
          </ul>       
      </p>
      <p>Since I was younger, I have always believed in the importance of hard work and doing everything to the best of my abilities.
          I have always been the type of person to finish what I start, and put my best foot forward.
          Although I am often busy, some of my hobbies include:
          <ul>
